# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
🔹 Software engineering  is the systematic development, implementation and  maintenance of high quality software systems by application of engineering principles, methods and tools..
🔹It enables creation of software systems applicable in the modern life to solve a problem or make life easier.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
🔹DEvelopment and evolution of programming languages
🔹Establishment of software engineering as discipline.
🔹Stat of structured programming languages and agile methodologies in programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
🔹Gathering information about the software
🔹Design the software
🔹IMplement by writing code for the software
🔹Test the software and fix any bugs that may have been.
🔹Deploy the software
🔹Maintenance of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
🔹Waterfall methodology is sequential  with distinct phases while agile methodologies are focused on flexibility collaboration and response to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
🔹SOftware developers write code and implement of the software
🔹Quality assurance engineer test and debugs the code.
🔹Project manage oversee planning execution and delivery of the software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
🔹IDE helps developers write, test and debugs the code
🔹Version control system provides the ability to control the code as it grow bigger and one can reference back to a moment in the code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers?
🔹Changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debts.

Provide strategies to overcome these challenges:
🔹Proper communication, regular reassessment, use of agile methodologies and task scheduling and prioritization.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
🔹Unit testing is testing individual components in a software structure
🔹Integration is testing how different components interact with each other in a software structure.
🔹System testing is testing the entire system software.
🔹Acceptance testing is gauging the software against the user requirement to ensure they meet the requirements.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
🔹Prompt engineering is giving clear and concise instructions to an AI model so as to get a correct and precise response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
❌ VAGUE PROMPT: Write an invitation letter.
✔️ SPECIFIC PROMPT: Write an official invitation letter to the board of director to attend a new super product launch.
